1. print out '3'; because i is for counting how many items in the array, and there are 3 numbers in the prices array
2. print out '150'; discountedPrice is the variable to calculate the discount price, and the loop make it to the last item, 300*(1-0.5)=150
3. print out '150'; also loop to the last item, 150 (discountedPrice) *100/100 = 150
4. [50, 100, 150]; because when it calculate a finalPrice, it will push the finalPrice into the discounted array as one of the item
5. error: i is only defined in for-oloop
6. error: discountedPrice is only defined in for-loop
7. 150; reason is the same as (3)
8. [50, 100, 150]; reason is the same as (4)
9. error: reason is same as (5)
10. 3; the length of the prices ([100, 200, 300]) is 3
11. [50, 100, 150]; reason is the same as (4) and (8)
12. A. student name B. student['Grad Year'] C. student.greeting() D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name E. student.courseLoad[1]
13. A. "32" B. 1 C. 3 D. "3null" E. 4 F. 0 G. "3undefined" H. NaN
14. A. true B. false C. true D. false E. false F. true
15. === inclued the comparison of data type, so if the data type is different, === will return false; in contrast, == does not consider data type, so 2=='2' will return true

17. [2, 4, 6]; we pass the array [1, 2, 3] into the function modifyArray, then we use the loop to pass every item to the function doSomething to double the number
